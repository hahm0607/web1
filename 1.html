  <h2>substitution reaction</h2>
  <p>
  A substitution reaction (also known as single displacement reaction or single
  substitution reaction) is a chemical reaction during which one functional group
   in a chemical compound is replaced by another functional group.
   Substitution reactions are of prime importance in organic chemistry.
   Substitution reactions in organic chemistry are classified either as electrophilic
  or nucleophilic depending upon the reagent involved, whether a reactive intermediate
   involved in the reaction is a carbocation, a carbanion or a free radical,
   and whether the substrate is aliphatic or aromatic. Detailed understanding of
  a reaction type helps to predict the product outcome in a reaction.
  It also is helpful for optimizing a reaction with regard to variables
  such as temperature and choice of solvent.
